Utilizes Streamlit for user interface and IMDB API for the movie rating



In this project, we recommend movies to the users based on their personalized 
searches.Both people and online streaming services need a user based personalized movie 
recommendation system which helps in analyzing the interests of each individual and 
recommends the best movies suited to them. The approach used for building the movie 
recommendation system is content-based filtering.As we know that content-based filtering 
analyses the user's past behavior and recommends items similar to it based on the 
parameters considered. In this Content-based movie recommender system gives their 
recommendations based on attributes like Ratings, Genre, and Casts.


Online Movie Recommendation System aims to recommend movies to users based on usermovie item ratings, genre, cast. The goal of the project is to recommend top similar movies 
to the user according to what he or she wants to watch which also saves up a lot of time for 
the user. It is a web application that allows users to search for movies as well as 
recommends appropriate movies based on their search patterns
